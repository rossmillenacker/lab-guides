Lab Exercises
=============

Perform these exercises when instructed by your Delphix Instructor.

Part I
======
Optional Advanced Exercise - Perform a Storage Performance Test through the CLI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will:
-  Log into the Delphix Engine prior to configuration via the Delphix Command Line Interface (CLI)
-  Perform a Storage Test
-  View the Storage Test Results

**Steps**

As an advanced exercise, this lab has no corresponding Lab Solution. Instead, we will walk through the steps to get you acquainted with your lab system and the Delphix CLI.

1.  On your Lab Server desktop, double-click on Terminal
2.  Type: ssh <sysadmin@10.0.x.10> ('x' is your **Student Number** assigned by your instructor)
  
  a.  If you receive a prompt asking you if you are sure you want to connect, enter: Yes
  b.  Enter the password: sysadmin
  c.  Escape to the standard CLI prompt by typing: discard
  d.  You are now at the root of the Delphix CLI as a System Administrator
