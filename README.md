## <a id="welcome"></a>Welcome to the Lab Guide

This guide is aimed at users or students participating in a Delphix hands-on lab.
It supplement to the Delphix Admin Training courses,
and provides several exercises to perform throughout the class. If you
encounter any issues during the exercises, please do not hesitate to ask your
instructor for advice.

## <a id="requirements"></a>Lab Requirements

  * A modern HTML5 capable web browser (IE10+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## <a id="traininglab"></a>The Delphix Admin Training Cloud Lab

Your instructor should have provided you with a **Class Name** and a **Student
Number**. In order access your lab server, point your web browser to: http://
**classname**.agile.today/ **studentnumber**
For example, if your **Class Name** is  "acmetech" and your **Student Number**
is 5, you would go to the site: http://acmetech.agile.today/5

The Delphix Labs Login Dialog

At the login screen, enter the username and password: delphix/delphix
Once you have logged in, you will be connected to your lab server. This server
contains everything you will need to perform your lab exercises including:

  * RDP Client (Remmina) to connect to Windows Source and Target servers
  * Terminal and PuTTY to connect to Linux Source and Target servers
  * Chrome Web Browser
  * Notepad for class notes
  *	Oracle SQL Developer for remote connections to Oracle Databases
  * Lab Guides folder on the Desktop containing any exercises for this course, including this guide.

example, if your student number is  "5," your Delphix Engine will be located at "10.0.5.10".

**NOTE: Please record your student number and IP addresses, as using another student's number will cause problems during the exercises**

Server  | IP Address
------- | -----------
Delphix Engine | 10.0.x.10
Linux Source | 10.0.x.20
Linux Target| 10.0.x.30

## <a id="rdpclient"></a>The RDP Client

Your lab server contains an RDP client that is pre-populated with the
Windows Source and Target servers. When you connect to a Windows system, the
screen will be larger than your Student Desktop. You can use the toolbar at
the top of the RDP client to switch to Full Screen mode. When you wish to
leave Full Screen mode, you can hover your mouse over the top of the Windows
screen until the RDP menu drops down, and toggle off Full Screen.
